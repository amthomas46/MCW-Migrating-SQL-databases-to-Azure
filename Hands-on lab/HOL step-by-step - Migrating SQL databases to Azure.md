# Migrating SQL databases to Azure hands-on lab step-by-step

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hands-on lab, you will implement a proof-of-concept (PoC) for migrating an on-premises SQL Server 2008 R2 database into Azure SQL Database Managed Instance (SQL MI). You will perform assessments to reveal any feature parity and compatibility issues between the on-premises SQL Server 2008 R2 database and the managed database offerings in Azure. You will then migrate the customer's on-premises gamer information web application and database into Azure, with minimal to no down-time. Finally, you will enable some of the advanced SQL features available in SQL MI to improve security and performance in the customer's application.

At the end of this hands-on lab, you will be better able to implement a cloud migration solution for business-critical applications and databases.

## Overview

Tailspin Toys is the developer of several popular online video games. Founded in 2010, the company has experienced exponential growth since releasing the first installment of their most popular game franchise to include online multiplayer gameplay. They have since built upon this success by adding online capabilities to the majority of their game portfolio.

Adding online gameplay has greatly increased popularity of their games, but the rapid increase in demand for their services has made supporting the current setup problematic. To facilitate online gameplay, they host gaming services on-premises using rented hardware. For each game, their gaming services setup consists of three virtual machines running the gaming software and five game databases hosted on a single SQL Server 2008 R2 instance. In addition to the dedicated gaming VMs and databases, they also host authentication and gateway VMs and databases, which are shared by all their games. At its foundation, Tailspin Toys is a game development company, made up primarily of software developers. The few dedicated database and infrastructure resources they do have are struggling to keep up with their ever-increasing workload.

Tailspin Toys is hoping that migrating their services from on-premises to the cloud can help to alleviate some of their infrastructure management issues, while simultaneously helping them to refocus their efforts on delivering business value by releasing new and improved games. They are looking for a proof-of-concept (PoC) for migrating their gamer information web application and database into the cloud. They maintain their gamer information database, `TailspinToys`, on an on-premises SQL Server 2008 R2 database. This system is used by gamers to update their profiles, view leader boards, purchase game add-ons and more. Since this system helps to drive revenue, it is considered a business-critical application, and needs to be highly-available. They are aware that SQL Server 2008 R2 is approaching end of support, and are looking at options for migrating this database into Azure. They have read about some of the advanced security and performance tuning options that are available only in Azure and would prefer to a migrate the database into a platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offering, if possible. Tailspin Toys is using the Service Broker feature of SQL Server for messaging within the `TailspinToys` database. This functionality is being used for several critical processes, and they cannot afford to lose this capability when migrating their operations database to the cloud. They have also stated that, at this time, they do not have the resources to rearchitect the solution to use an alternative message broker.

## Solution architecture

Below is a diagram of the solution architecture you will build in this lab. Please study this carefully, so you understand the whole of the solution as you are working on the various components.

![This solution diagram includes a virtual network containing SQL MI in a isolated subnet, along with a JumpBox VM and Database Migration Service in a management subnet. The MI Subnet displays both the primary managed instance, along with a read-only replica, which is accessed by reports from the web app. The web app connects to SQL MI via a subnet gateway and point-to-site VPN. The web app is published to App Services using Visual Studio 2019. An online data migration is conducted from the on-premises SQL Server to SQL MI using the Azure Database Migration Service, which reads backup files from an SMB network share.](./media/preferred-solution-architecture.png "Preferred Solution diagram")

The solution begins with using the Microsoft Data Migration Assistant to perform assessments of feature parity and compatibility of the on-premises SQL Server 2008 R2 database against both Azure SQL Database (Azure SQL DB) and Azure SQL Database Managed Instance (SQL MI), with the goal of migrating the `TailspinToys` database into an Azure PaaS offering with minimal or no changes. After completing the assessments and reviewing the findings, the SQL Server 2008 R2 database is migrated into SQL MI using the Azure Database Migration Service's online data migration option. This allows the database to be migrated with little to no downtime, by using a backup and transaction logs stored in an SMB network share.

The web app is deployed to an Azure App Service Web App using Visual Studio 2019. Once the database has been migrated and cutover, the `TailspinToysWeb` application is configured to talk to the SQL MI VNet through a virtual network gateway using point-to-site VPN, and its connection strings are updated to point to the new SQL MI database.

In SQL MI, several features of Azure SQL Database are examined. Advanced Data Security (ADS) is enabled and Data Discovery and Classification is used to better understand the data and potential compliance issues with data in the database. The ADS Vulnerability Assessment is used to identify potential security vulnerabilities and issues in the database, and those finding are used to mitigate one finding by enabling Transparent Data Encryption in the database. Dynamic Data Masking (DDM) is used to prevent sensitive data from appearing when querying the database. Finally, Read Scale-out is used to point reports on the Tailspin Toys web app to a read-only secondary, allowing reporting to occur without impacting the performance of the primary database.

## Requirements

- Microsoft Azure subscription must be pay-as-you-go or MSDN.
  - Trial subscriptions will not work.
  - Rights to create an Azure Active Directory application and service principal and assign roles on your subscription.
- A virtual machine configured with Visual Studio Community 2019 or higher (setup in the Before the hands-on lab exercises).

## Exercise 1: Perform database assessments

Duration: 30 minutes

In this exercise, you will use the Microsoft Data Migration Assistant (DMA) to perform assessments on the `TailspinToys` database. You will create two assessments, one for a migration to Azure SQL Database, and then a second for SQL MI. These assessments will provide reports about any feature parity and compatibility issues between the on-premises database and the Azure managed SQL database service options.

> DMA helps you upgrade to a modern data platform by detecting compatibility issues that can impact database functionality in your new version of SQL Server or Azure SQL Database. DMA recommends performance and reliability improvements for your target environment and allows you to move your schema, data, and uncontained objects from your source server to your target server. To learn more, read the [Data Migration Assistant documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/dma/dma-overview?view=azuresqldb-mi-current).

### Task 1: Restore the TailspinToys database on the SqlServer2008 VM [AT] 8:32-8:38, I think steps 6-20 could be done as part of the ARM template.

Before you begin the assessments, you need to restore a copy of the `TailspinToys` database in your SQL Server 2008 R2 instance. In this task, you will create an RDP connection to the SqlServer2008 VM and then restore the `TailspinToys` database onto the SQL Server 2008 R2 instance using a backup provided by Tailspin Toys.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to your **SqlServer2008** VM by selecting **Resource groups** from the left-hand navigation menu, selecting the **hands-on-lab-SUFFIX** resource group, and selecting the **SqlServer2008** VM from the list of resources. On the SqlServer2008 Virtual Machine's **Overview** blade, select **Connect** on the top menu.

    ![The SqlServer2008 VM blade is displayed, with the Connect button highlighted in the top menu.](./media/connect-sqlserver2008.png "Connect to SqlServer2008 VM")

2. On the Connect to virtual machine blade, select **Download RDP File**, then open the downloaded RDP file.

3. Select **Connect** on the Remote Desktop Connection dialog.

    ![In the Remote Desktop Connection Dialog Box, the Connect button is highlighted.](./media/remote-desktop-connection-sql-2008.png "Remote Desktop Connection dialog")

4. Enter the following credentials when prompted, and then select **OK**:

    - **Username**: sqlmiuser
    - **Password**: Password.1234567890

    ![The credentials specified above are entered into the Enter your credentials dialog.](media/rdc-credentials-sql-2008.png "Enter your credentials")

5. Select **Yes** to connect, if prompted that the identity of the remote computer cannot be verified.

    ![In the Remote Desktop Connection dialog box, a warning states that the identity of the remote computer cannot be verified, and asks if you want to continue anyway. At the bottom, the Yes button is circled.](./media/remote-desktop-connection-identity-verification-sqlserver2008.png "Remote Desktop Connection dialog")

> [AT] Could Step 6 be done ahead of time?
6. Once logged into the SqlServer2008 VM, download a [backup of the TailspinToys database](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/Migrating-SQL-databases-to-Azure/master/Hands-on%20lab/lab-files/Database/TailspinToys.bak), and save it to the `C:\` of the VM.

7. Next, open **Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 17** by entering "sql server" into the search bar in the Windows Start menu.

    ![SQL Server is entered into the Windows Start menu search box, and Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 17 is highlighted in the search results.](media/start-menu-ssms-17.png "Windows start menu search")

8. In the SSMS **Connect to Server** dialog, enter **SQLSERVER2008** into the Server name box, ensure **Windows Authentication** is selected, and then select **Connect**.

    ![The SQL Server Connect to Search dialog is displayed, with SQLSERVER2008 entered into the Server name and Windows Authentication selected.](media/sql-server-connect-to-server.png "Connect to Server")

9. Once connected, right-click **Databases** under SQLSERVER2008 in the Object Explorer, and then select **Restore Database** from the context menu.

    ![In the SSMS Object Explorer, the context menu for Databases is displayed and Restore Database is highlighted.](media/ssms-databases-restore.png "SSMS Object Explorer")

10. You will now restore the `TailspinToys` database using the downloaded `TailspinToys.bak` file. On the **General** page of the Restore Database dialog, select **Device** under Source, and then select the Browse (...) button to the right of the Device box.

    ![Under Source in the Restore Database dialog, Device is selected and highlighted, and the Browse button is highlighted.](media/ssms-restore-database-source.png "Restore Database source")

11. In the **Select backup devices** dialog that appears, select **Add**.

    ![In the Select backup devices dialog, the Add button is highlighted.](media/ssms-restore-database-select-devices.png "Select backup devices")

12. In the **Locate Backup File** dialog, browse to the location you saved the downloaded `TailspinToys.bak` file, select that file, and then select **OK**.

    ![In the Location Backup File dialog, the TailspinToys.bak file is selected and highlighted.](media/ssms-restore-database-locate-backup-file.png "Locate Backup File")

13. Select **OK** on the **Select backup devices** dialog. This will return you to the Restore Database dialog. The dialog will now contain the information required to restore the `TailspinToys` database.

    ![The completed Restore Database dialog is displayed, with the TailSpinToys database specified as the target.](media/ssms-restore-database.png "Restore Database")

14. Select **OK** to start the restore.

15. Select **OK** in the dialog when the database restore is complete.

    ![A dialog is displayed with a message that the database TailspinToys was restored successfully.](media/ssms-restore-database-success.png "Restored successfully")

16. Next, you will execute a script in SSMS, which will reset the `sa` password, enable mixed mode authentication, enable Service broker, create the `WorkshopUser` account, and change the database recovery model to FULL. To create the script, open a new query window in SSMS by selecting **New Query** in the SSMS toolbar.

    ![The New Query button is highlighted in the SSMS toolbar.](media/ssms-new-query.png "SSMS Toolbar")

17. Copy and paste the SQL script below into the new query window:

    ```sql
    USE master;
    GO

    -- SET the sa password
    ALTER LOGIN [sa] WITH PASSWORD=N'Password.1234567980';
    GO

    -- Enable Service Broker on the database
    ALTER DATABASE TailspinToys SET ENABLE_BROKER WITH ROLLBACK immediate;
    GO

    -- Enable Mixed Mode Authentication
    EXEC xp_instance_regwrite N'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE',
    N'Software\Microsoft\MSSQLServer\MSSQLServer', N'LoginMode', REG_DWORD, 2;
    GO

    -- Create a login and user named WorkshopUser
    CREATE LOGIN WorkshopUser WITH PASSWORD = N'Password.1234567890';
    GO

    EXEC sp_addsrvrolemember
        @loginame = N'WorkshopUser',
        @rolename = N'sysadmin';
    GO

    USE TailspinToys;
    GO

    IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM sys.database_principals WHERE name = N'WorkshopUser')
    BEGIN
        CREATE USER [WorkshopUser] FOR LOGIN [WorkshopUser]
        EXEC sp_addrolemember N'db_datareader', N'WorkshopUser'
    END;
    GO

    -- Update the recovery model of the database to FULL
    ALTER DATABASE TailspinToys SET RECOVERY FULL;
    GO
    ```

18. To run the script, select **Execute** from the SSMS toolbar.

    ![The Execute button is highlighted in the SSMS toolbar.](media/ssms-execute.png "SSMS Toolbar")

19. For Mixed Mode Authentication and the new `sa` password to take effect, you must restart the SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER) Service on the SqlServer2008 VM. To do this, you can use SSMS. Right-click the SQLSERVER2008 instance in the SSMS Object Explorer, and then select **Restart** from the context menu.

    ![In the SSMS Object Explorer, the context menu for the SQLSERVER2008 instance is displayed, and Restart is highlighted.](media/ssms-object-explorer-restart-sqlserver2008.png "Object Explorer")

20. When prompted about restarting the MSSQLSERVER service, select **Yes**. The service will take a few seconds to restart.

    ![The Yes button is highlighted on the dialog asking if you are sure you want to restart the MSSQLSERVER service.](media/ssms-restart-service.png "Restart MSSQLSERVER service")

### Task 2: Perform assessment for migration to Azure SQL Database [AT] 8:41-

In this task, you will use the Microsoft Data Migration Assistant (DMA) to perform an assessment of the `TailspinToys` database against Azure SQL Database (Azure SQL DB). The assessment will provide a report about any feature parity and compatibility issues between the on-premises database and the Azure SQL DB service.

1. On the SqlServer2008 VM, launch DMA from the Windows Start menu by typing "data migration" into the search bar, and then selecting **Microsoft Data Migration Assistant** in the search results.

    ![In the Windows Start menu, "data migration" is entered into the search bar, and Microsoft Data Migration Assistant is highlighted in the Windows start menu search results.](media/windows-start-menu-dma.png "Data Migration Assistant")

2. In the DMA dialog, select **+** from the left-hand menu to create a new project.

    ![The new project icon is highlighted in DMA.](media/dma-new.png "New DMA project")

    - **Project type**: Select Assessment.
    - **Project name**: Enter ToAzureSqlDb.
    - **Source server type**: Select SQL Server.
    - **Target server type**: Select Azure SQL Database.

    ![New project settings for doing an assessment of a migration from SQL Server to Azure SQL Database.](media/dma-new-project-to-azure-sql-db.png "New project settings")

4. Select **Create**.

5. On the **Options** screen, ensure **Check database compatibility** and **Check feature parity** are both checked, and then select **Next**.

    ![Check database compatibility and check feature parity are checked on the Options screen.](media/dma-options.png "DMA options")

6. On the **Sources** screen, enter the following into the **Connect to a server** dialog that appears on the right-hand side:

    - **Server name**: Enter **SQLSERVER2008**.
    - **Authentication type**: Select **SQL Server Authentication**.
    - **Username**: Enter **WorkshopUser**
    - **Password**: Enter **Password.1234567890**
    - **Encrypt connection**: Check this box.
    - **Trust server certificate**: Check this box.

    ![In the Connect to a server dialog, the values specified above are entered into the appropriate fields.](media/dma-connect-to-a-server.png "Connect to a server")

7. Select **Connect**.

8. On the **Add sources** dialog that appears next, check the box for **TailspinToys** and select **Add**.

    ![The TailspinToys box is checked on the Add sources dialog.](media/dma-add-sources.png "Add sources")

9. Select **Start Assessment**.

    ![Start assessment](media/dma-start-assessment-to-azure-sql-db.png "Start assessment")

10. Review the assessment of ability to migrate to Azure SQL DB.

    ![For a target platform of Azure SQL DB, feature parity shows two features which are not supported in Azure SQL DB. The Service broker feature is selected on the left and on the right Service Broker feature is not supported in Azure SQL Database is highlighted.](media/dma-feature-parity-service-broker-not-supported.png "Database feature parity")

    > The DMA assessment for a migrating the `TailspinToys` database to a target platform of Azure SQL DB shows two features in use which are not supported. These features, cross-database references and Service broker, will prevent TailspinToys from being able to migrate to the Azure SQL DB PaaS offering without first making changes to their database.

### Task 3: Perform assessment for migration to Azure SQL Database Managed Instance

With one PaaS offering ruled out due to feature parity, you will now perform a second assessment. In this task, you will use DMA to perform an assessment of the `TailspinToys` database against Azure SQL Database Managed Instance (SQL MI). The assessment will provide a report about any feature parity and compatibility issues between the on-premises database and the SQL MI service.

1. To get started, select **+** on the left-hand menu in DMA to create another new project.

    ![The new project icon is highlighted in DMA.](media/dma-new.png "New DMA project")

2. In the New project pane, set the following:

    - **Project type**: Select Assessment.
    - **Project name**: Enter ToSqlMi.
    - **Source server type**: Select SQL Server.
    - **Target server type**: Select Azure SQL Database Managed Instance.

    ![New project settings for doing an assessment of a migration from SQL Server to Azure SQL Database Managed Instance.](media/dma-new-project-to-sql-mi.png "New project settings")

3. Select **Create**.

4. On the **Options** screen, ensure **Check database compatibility** and **Check feature parity** are both checked, and then select **Next**.

    ![Check database compatibility and check feature parity are checked on the Options screen.](media/dma-options.png "DMA options")

5. On the **Sources** screen, enter the following into the **Connect to a server** dialog that appears on the right-hand side:

    - **Server name**: Enter **SQLSERVER2008**.
    - **Authentication type**: Select **SQL Server Authentication**.
    - **Username**: Enter **WorkshopUser**.
    - **Password**: Enter **Password.1234567890**.
    - **Encrypt connection**: Check this box.
    - **Trust server certificate**: Check this box.

    ![In the Connect to a server dialog, the values specified above are entered into the appropriate fields.](media/dma-connect-to-a-server.png "Connect to a server")

6. Select **Connect**.

7. On the **Add sources** dialog that appears next, check the box for **TailspinToys** and select **Add**.

    ![The TailspinToys box is checked on the Add sources dialog.](media/dma-add-sources.png "Add sources")

8. Select **Start Assessment**.

    ![Start assessment](media/dma-start-assessment-to-sql-mi.png "Start assessment")

9. Review the assessment of ability to migrate to Azure SQL Database Managed Instance.

    ![For a target platform of Azure SQL Database Managed Instance, feature parity with PowerShell job step is listed.](media/dma-feature-parity-sql-mi.png "Database feature parity")

    >**Note**: The assessment report for a migrating the `TailspinToys` database to a target platform of Azure SQL Database Managed Instance shows feature parity only with a PowerShell job step. The step listed is associated with a built-in SQL Server Agent Job, and it will not impact the migration of the `TailspinToys` database to SQL MI.

10. The database, including the cross-database references and Service broker features, can be migrated as is, providing the opportunity for TailspinToys to have a fully managed PaaS database running in Azure. Previously, their options for migrating a database using features, such as Service Broker, incompatible with Azure SQL Database, were to deploy the database to a virtual machine running in Azure (IaaS) or modify their database and applications to not use the unsupported features. The introduction of Azure SQL MI, however, provides the ability to migrate databases into a managed Azure SQL database service with near 100% compatibility, including the features that prevented them from using Azure SQL Database.

[AT] Then upload to Azure Migrate 8:48-8:54

## Exercise 2: Migrate the database to SQL MI

Duration: 60 minutes

In this exercise, you will use the [Azure Database Migration Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/database-migration/) (DMS) to migrate the `TailspinToys` database from the on-premises SQL 2008 R2 database to SQL MI. Tailspin Toys mentioned the importance of their gamer information web application in driving revenue, so for this migration you will target the [Business Critical service tier](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance#managed-instance-service-tiers).

> The Business Critical service tier is designed for business applications with the highest performance and high-availability (HA) requirements. To learn more, read the [Managed Instance service tiers documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance#managed-instance-service-tiers).

### Task 1: Create an SMB network share on the SqlServer2008 VM [AT] 9:04-9:05

In this task, you will create a new SMB network share on the SqlServer2008 VM. This will be the folder used by DMS for retrieving backups of the `TailspinToys` database during the database migration process.

1. On the SqlServer2008 VM, open **Windows Explorer** by selecting its icon on the Windows Task bar.

    ![The Windows Explorer icon is highlighted in the Windows Task Bar.](media/windows-task-bar.png "Windows Task Bar")

## Exercise 5: Improve database security posture with Advanced Data Security [AT] 8:18-8:23

Duration: 30 minutes

In this exercise you will enable Advanced Data Security (ADS) on your SQL MI database, and explore some of the security benefits that come with running your database in Azure. [SQL Database Advance Data Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-advanced-data-security) (ADS) provides advanced SQL security capabilities, including functionality for discovering and classifying sensitive data, surfacing and mitigating potential database vulnerabilities, and detecting anomalous activities that could indicate a threat to your database.

### Task 1: Enable Advanced Data Security

In this task, you will enable ADS for all databases on the Managed Instance.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **Resource groups** from the left-hand menu, select the **hands-on-lab-SUFFIX** resource group, and then select the **TailspinToys** Managed database resource from the list.

    ![The TailspinToys Managed Database is highlighted in the resources list.](media/resources-sql-mi-database.png "Resources")

2. On the TailspinToys Managed database blade, select **Advanced Data Security** from the left-hand menu, under Security, and then select **Enable Advanced Data Security on the managed instance**.

    ![In the Advanced Data Security blade of the Managed database, the Enable Advanced Data Security on the managed instance button is highlighted.](media/managed-database-ads.png "Advanced Data Security")

3. Within a few minutes, ADS will be enabled for all databases on the Managed Instance. You will see the three tiles on the Advanced Data Security blade become enabled when it has been enabled.

    ![The enabled tiles on the Advance Data Security blade are displayed.](media/ads-panels.png "Advanced Data Security")

### Task 2: Configure SQL Data Discovery and Classification

In this task, you will look at the [SQL Data Discovery and Classification](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/security/sql-data-discovery-and-classification?view=sql-server-2017) feature of Advanced Data Security. Data Discovery & Classification introduces a new tool for discovering, classifying, labeling & reporting the sensitive data in your databases. It introduces a set of advanced services, forming a new SQL Information Protection paradigm aimed at protecting the data in your database, not just the database. Discovering and classifying your most sensitive data (business, financial, healthcare, etc.) can play a pivotal role in your organizational information protection stature.

>**Note**: This functionality is currently available *in Preview* for SQL MI through the Azure portal.

1. On the Advanced Data Security blade, select the **Data Discovery & Classification** tile.

    ![The Data Discovery & Classification tile is displayed.](media/ads-data-discovery-and-classification-pane.png "Advanced Data Security")

2. In the **Data Discovery & Classification** blade, select the info link with the message **We have found 40 columns with classification recommendations**.

    ![The recommendations link on the Data Discovery & Classification blade is highlighted.](media/ads-data-discovery-and-classification-recommendations-link.png "Data Discovery & Classification")

3. Look over the list of recommendations to get a better understanding of the types of data and classifications are assigned, based on the built-in classification settings. In the list of classification recommendations, select the recommendation for the **Sales - CreditCard - CardNumber** field.

    ![The CreditCard number recommendation is highlighted in the recommendations list.](media/ads-data-discovery-and-classification-recommendations-credit-card.png "Data Discovery & Classification")

4. Due to the risk of exposing credit card information, Tailspin Toys would like a way to classify it as highly confidential, not just **Confidential**, as the recommendation suggests. To correct this, select **+ Add classification** at the top of the Data Discovery & Classification blade.

    ![The +Add classification button is highlighted in the toolbar.](media/ads-data-discovery-and-classification-add-classification-button.png "Data Discovery & Classification")

5. Quickly expand the **Sensitivity label** field, and review the various built-in labels you can choose from. You can also add your own labels, should you desire.

    ![The list of built-in Sensitivity labels is displayed.](media/ads-data-discovery-and-classification-sensitivity-labels.png "Data Discovery & Classification")

6. In the Add classification dialog, enter the following:

    - **Schema name**: Select Sales.
    - **Table name**: Select CreditCard.
    - **Column name**: Select CardNumber (nvarchar).
    - **Information type**: Select Credit Card.
    - **Sensitivity level**: Select Highly Confidential.

    ![The values specified above are entered into the Add classification dialog.](media/ads-data-discovery-and-classification-add-classification.png "Add classification")

7. Select **Add classification**.

8. You will see the **Sales - CreditCard - CardNumber** field disappear from the recommendations list, and the number of recommendations drop by 1.

9. Other recommendations you can review are the **HumanResources - Employee** fields for **NationIDNumber** and **BirthDate**. Note that these have been flagged by the recommendation service as **Confidential - GDPR**. As Tailspin Toys maintains data about gamers from around the world, including Europe, having a tool which helps them discover data which may be relevant to GDPR compliance will be very helpful.

    ![GDPR information is highlighted in the list of recommendations](media/ads-data-discovery-and-classification-recommendations-gdpr.png "Data Discovery & Classification")

10. Check the **Select all** check box at the top of the list to select all the remaining recommended classifications, and then select **Accept selected recommendations**.

    ![All the recommended classifications are checked and the Accept selected recommendations button is highlighted.](media/ads-data-discovery-and-classification-accept-recommendations.png "Data Discovery & Classification")

11. Select **Save** on the toolbar of the Data Classification window. It may take several minutes for the save to complete.

    ![Save the updates to the classified columns list.](media/ads-data-discovery-and-classification-save.png "Save")
    
    >**Note**: This feature is still in preview.  If you receive an error when saving, try returning to the Advanced Data Security blade, and selecting the Data Discovery & Classification tile again to see the results.

12. When the save completes, select the **Overview** tab on the Data Discovery & Classification blade to view a report with a full summary of the database classification state.

    ![The View Report button is highlighted on the toolbar.](media/ads-data-discovery-and-classification-overview-report.png "View report")

### Task 3: Review Advanced Data Security Vulnerability Assessment [AT] 8:23-8:26 - then needed to download ssms 18. 8:59-9:03

In this task, you will review an assessment report generated by ADS for the `TailspinToys` database and take action to remediate one of the findings in the `TailspinToys` database. The [SQL Vulnerability Assessment service](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-vulnerability-assessment) is a service that provides visibility into your security state, and includes actionable steps to resolve security issues, and enhance your database security.

1. Return to the **Advanced Data Security** blade for the `TailspinToys` Managed database and then select the **Vulnerability Assessment** tile.

    ![The Vulnerability tile is displayed.](media/ads-vulnerability-assessment-tile.png "Advanced Data Security")

2. On the Vulnerability Assessment blade, select **Scan** on the toolbar.

    ![Vulnerability assessment scan button.](media/vulnerability-assessment-scan.png "Scan")

3. When the scan completes, you will see a dashboard, displaying the number of failing checks, passing checks, and a breakdown of the risk summary by severity level.

    ![The Vulnerability Assessment dashboard is displayed.](media/sql-mi-vulnerability-assessment-dashboard.png "Vulnerability Assessment dashboard")

    >**Note**: Scans are run on a schedule, so if you see a message that no vulnerabilities are found your database may not have been scanned yet. You will need to run a scan manually. To do this, select the **Scan** button on the toolbar, and follow any prompts to start a scan. This will take a minute or so to complete.

4. In the scan results, take a few minutes to browse both the Failed and Passed checks, and review the types of checks that are performed. In the **Failed** the list, locate the security check for **Transparent data encryption**. This check has an ID of **VA1219**.

    ![The VA1219 finding for Transparent data encryption is highlighted.](media/sql-mi-vulnerability-assessment-failed-va1219.png "Vulnerability assessment")

5. Select the **VA1219** finding to view the detailed description.

    ![The details of the VA1219 - Transparent data encryption should be enabled finding are displayed with the description, impact, and remediation fields highlighted.](media/sql-mi-vulnerability-assessment-failed-va1219-details.png "Vulnerability Assessment")

    > The details for each finding provide more insight into the reason for the finding. Of note are the fields describing the finding, the impact of the recommended settings, and details on remediation for the finding.

6. You will now act on the recommendation remediation steps for the finding, and enable [Transparent Data Encryption](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/transparent-data-encryption-azure-sql) for the `TailspinToys` database. To accomplish this, you will switch over to using SSMS on your JumpBox VM for the next few steps.

    >**Note**: Transparent data encryption (TDE) needs to be manually enabled for Azure SQL Managed Instance. TDE helps protect Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL Managed Instance, and Azure Data Warehouse against the threat of malicious activity. It performs real-time encryption and decryption of the database, associated backups, and transaction log files at rest without requiring changes to the application.

7. On your JumpBox VM, open Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 18 from the Start menu, and enter the following information in the **Connect to Server** dialog.

    - **Server name**: Enter the fully qualified domain name of your SQL managed instance, which you copied from the Azure Cloud Shell in a previous task.
    - **Authentication**: Select SQL Server Authentication.
    - **Login**: Enter sqlmiuser
    - **Password**: Enter Password.1234567890
    - Check the **Remember password** box.

    ![The SQL managed instance details specified above are entered into the Connect to Server dialog.](media/ssms-18-connect-to-server.png "Connect to Server")

8. In SSMS, select **New Query** from the toolbar, paste the following SQL script into the new query window.

    ```sql
    ALTER DATABASE [TailspinToys] SET ENCRYPTION ON
    ```

    ![A new query window is displayed, with the script above pasted into it.](media/ssms-sql-mi-enable-tde.png "New query")

    > You turn transparent data encryption on and off on the database level. To enable transparent data encryption on a database in Azure SQL Managed Instance use must use T-SQL.

9. Select **Execute** from the SSMS toolbar. After a few seconds, you will see a message that the "Commands completed successfully."

    ![The Execute button is highlighted on the SSMS toolbar, and the Commands completed successfully message is highlighted in the output window.](media/ssms-sql-mi-enable-tde-success.png "Execute")

10. You can verify the encryption state and view information the associated encryption keys by using the [sys.dm_database_encryption_keys view](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-database-encryption-keys-transact-sql). Select **New Query** on the SSMS toolbar again, and paste the following query into the new query window:

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM sys.dm_database_encryption_keys
    ```

    ![The query above is pasted into a new query window in SSMS.](media/ssms-sql-mi-database-encryption-keys.png "New query")

11. Select **Execute** from the SSMS toolbar. You will see two records in the Results window, which provide information about the encryption state and keys used for encryption.

    ![The Execute button on the SSMS toolbar is highlighted, and in the Results pane the two records about the encryption state and keys for the TailspinToys database are highlighted.](media/ssms-sql-mi-database-encryption-keys-results.png "Results")

    > By default, service-managed transparent data encryption is used. A transparent data encryption certificate is automatically generated for the server that contains the database.

12. Return to the Azure portal and the Advanced Data Security - Vulnerability Assessment blade of the `TailspinToys` managed database. On the toolbar, select **Scan** to start a new assessment of the database.

    ![Vulnerability assessment scan button.](media/vulnerability-assessment-scan.png "Scan")

13. When the scan completes, select the **Failed** tab, enter **VA1219** into the search filter box, and observe that the previous failure is no longer in the Failed list.

    ![The Failed tab is highlighted and VA1219 is entered into the search filter. The list displays no results.](media/sql-mi-vulnerability-assessment-failed-filter-va1219.png "Failed")

14. Now, select the **Passed** tab, and observe the **VA1219** check is listed with a status of **PASS**.

    ![The Passed tab is highlighted and VA1219 is entered into the search filter. VA1219 with a status of PASS is highlighted in the results.](media/sql-mi-vulnerability-assessment-passed-va1219.png "Passed")

    > Using the SQL Vulnerability Assessment, it is simple to identify and remediate potential database vulnerabilities, allowing you to proactively improve your database security.

## Exercise 6: Enable Dynamic Data Masking

Duration: 15 minutes

In this exercise, you will enable [Dynamic Data Masking](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-dynamic-data-masking-get-started) (DDM) on credit card numbers in the `TailspinToys` database. DDM limits sensitive data exposure by masking it to non-privileged users. This feature helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data by enabling customers to designate how much of the sensitive data to reveal with minimal impact on the application layer. Itâs a policy-based security feature that hides the sensitive data in the result set of a query over designated database fields, while the data in the database is not changed.

> For example, a service representative at a call center may identify callers by several digits of their credit card number, but those data items should not be fully exposed to the service representative. A masking rule can be defined that masks all but the last four digits of any credit card number in the result set of any query. As another example, an appropriate data mask can be defined to protect personally identifiable information (PII) data, so that a developer can query production environments for troubleshooting purposes without violating compliance regulations.

> [AT] For more you can check out this extra lab for tailspin toys around dynamic data masking. TODO add link and more explanation!

## Exercise 7: Use online secondary for read-only queries

Duration: 15 minutes

In this exercise, you will look at how you can use the automatically created online secondary for reporting, without feeling the impacts of a heavy transactional load on the primary database. Each database in the SQL MI Business Critical tier is automatically provisioned with several AlwaysON replicas to support the availability SLA. Using [**Read Scale-Out**](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-read-scale-out) allows you to load balance Azure SQL Database read-only workloads using the capacity of one read-only replica.

### Task 1: View Leaderboard report in TailspinToys web application

In this task, you will open a web report using the web application you deployed to your App Service.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **Resource groups** from the left-hand menu, and then select the resource group named **hands-on-lab-SUFFIX**.

   ![The hands-on-lab-SUFFIX resource group is selected.](media/resource-groups.png "Resource groups")

2. In the hands-on-lab-SUFFIX resource group, select the **tailspintoysUNIQUEID** App Service from the list of resources.

   ![The App Service resource is selected from the list of resources in the hands-on-lab-SUFFIX resource group.](media/rg-app-service.png "hands-on-lab-SUFFIX resource group")

3. On the App Service overview blade, select the **URL** to open the web application in a browser window.

   ![The App service URL is highlighted.](media/app-service-url.png "App service URL")

4. In the TailspinToys web app, select **Leaderboard** from the menu.

   ![READ_WRITE is highlighted on the Leaderboard page.](media/tailspin-toys-leaderboard-read-write.png "TailspinToys Web App")

   > Note the `READ_WRITE` string on the page. This is the output from reading the `Updateability` property associated with the `ApplicationIntent` option on the target database. This can be retrieved using the SQL query `SELECT DATABASEPROPERTYEX(DB_NAME(), "Updateability")`.

### Task 2: Update read only connection string

[AT] This is a 5 minute lab but requires updating the default application setting to be set to ReadWrite instead of ReadOnly and then here they run it locally and then change to ReadOnly to see update. May want to add some explanation as well for what is happening.

In this task, you will enable Read Scale-Out for the `TailspinToys`database, using the `ApplicationIntent` option in the connection string. This option dictates whether the connection is routed to the write replica or to a read-only replica. Specifically, if the `ApplicationIntent` value is `ReadWrite` (the default value), the connection will be directed to the databaseâs read-write replica. If the `ApplicationIntent` value is `ReadOnly`, the connection is routed to a read-only replica.

1. Return to the App Service blade in the Azure portal and select **Configuration** under Settings on the left-hand side.

   ![The Configuration item is selected under Settings.](media/app-service-configuration-menu.png "Configuration")

2. On the Configuration blade, scroll down and locate the connection string named `TailspinToysReadOnlyContext` within the **Connection strings** section, and select the Pencil (edit) icon on the right.

   ![The edit icon next to the read-only connection string is highlighted.](media/app-service-configuration-connection-strings-read-only.png "Connection strings")

3. In the Add/Edit connection string dialog, select the **Value** for the `TailspinToysReadOnlyContext` and paste the following parameter to end of the connection string.

   ```sql
   ApplicationIntent=ReadOnly;
   ```

4. The `TailspinToysReadOnlyContext` connection string should now look something like the following:

   ```sql
   Server=tcp:sqlmi-abcmxwzksiqoo.15b8611394c5.database.windows.net,1433;Database=TailspinToys;User ID=sqlmiuser;Password=Password.1234567890;Trusted_Connection=False;Encrypt=True;TrustServerCertificate=True;ApplicationIntent=ReadOnly;
   ```

5. Select **Update**.

6. Select **Save** at the top of the Configuration blade.

   ![The save button on the Application settings blade is highlighted.](media/app-service-configuration-save.png "Save")

### Task 3: Reload Leaderboard report in the Tailspin Toys web app

In this task, you will refresh the Leaderboard report in the Tailspin Toys web app, and observe the result.

1. Return to the TailspinToys gamer information website you opened previously, and refresh the **Leaderboard** page. The page should now look similar to the following:

    ![READ_ONLY is highlighted on the Reports page.](media/tailspin-toys-leaderboard-read-only.png "TailspinToys Web App")

    > Notice the `updateability` option is now displaying as `READ_ONLY`. With a simple addition to your database connection string, you are able to send read-only queries to the online secondary of your SQL MI Business critical database, allowing you to load-balance read-only workloads using the capacity of one read-only replica. The SQL MI Business Critical cluster has built-in Read Scale-Out capability that provides free-of charge built-in read-only node that can be used to run read-only queries that should not affect performance of your primary workload.

## After the hands-on lab

Duration: 10 minutes

In this exercise, you will de-provision all Azure resources that were created in support of this hands-on lab.

### Task 1: Delete Azure resource groups

1. In the Azure portal, select **Resource groups** from the left-hand menu, and locate and delete the **hands-on-lab-SUFFIX** following resource group.

### Task 2: Delete the tailspin-toys service principal

1. In the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory** and then select **App registrations**.

2. Select the **tailspin-toys** application, and select **Delete** on the application blade.

You should follow all steps provided *after* attending the Hands-on lab.
